## My Process
    - Setup: Structured the project with semantic HTML5 and external CSS, importing the "Outfit" font via Google Fonts.
    - HTML: Created a clean, accessible layout using descriptive class names and logical content hierarchy.
    - CSS: Styled the component with custom properties, Flexbox for layout, and a mobile-first approach. Added box-shadow for depth and media   -- - queries for responsiveness.
    - Testing: Verified design accuracy and responsiveness across screen sizes.
    - Refinement: Iteratively adjusted spacing, font sizes, and alignment to match the mockup.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Author
    - I have over 20 years of professional development experience, starting with a decade in embedded systems where I worked with assembly, C, and - C++. For the past 10+ years, I’ve specialized in iPhone application development using Objective-C and Swift. Recently, I’ve ventured into -- - starting my own business, which sparked my interest in web development. After spending months studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a - strong theoretical foundation, I’m now putting those skills into practice through hands-on challenges like those offered by Frontend Mentor.

### What I Learned

This challenge helped reinforce the importance of layout structure and reusable CSS properties. I practiced:
- Using **CSS custom properties** to maintain a consistent color palette and typography.
- Designing with a **mobile-first approach**, which makes the site responsive and ensures a good user experience on smaller devices.
- Implementing **box-shadow** for clean, modern card styling.

Here’s a snippet of CSS I’m particularly proud of:
```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  padding: var(--spacing-200, 16px) var(--spacing-200, 16px)
    var(--spacing-500, 40px) var(--spacing-200, 16px);
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start;
  gap: var(--spacing-300, 24px);
  border-radius: 20px;
  background: var(--color-white, #fff);
  box-shadow: 0px 25px 25px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 324px;
}
